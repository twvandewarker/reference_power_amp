# reference_power_amp

In progress - This is a reference power amp based on the Texas Instruments TPA3251 class D evaluation module. It's powered by a 350W 36V Mean Well switching power supply, and the whole thing is going into a Hammond 2U rack mount enclosure. The amp should be capable of 80W stereo into 8 ohms at 1%THD.
